# tunability

This repository was used for the calculation of tunability measures and tuning spaces as described in the paper:

[Tunability: Importance of Hyperparameters of Machine Learning Algorithms](http://www.jmlr.org/papers/v20/18-444.html)

For the calculation just run the [main.R](https://github.com/PhilippPro/tunability/blob/master/main.R) file. 
The calculation can take several days to finish.
